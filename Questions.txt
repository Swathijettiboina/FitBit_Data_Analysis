Hello, Sorry for troubling you in weekend.
i am having few doubts regarding this use case, as per our previous meet , you said that you are leading the bussiness called FitBit,
and your are having some data, now to move further, i need some clarifications about the bussiness,customers and end goals
they are-----

1.Can you briefly describe what your company does?
2.What products or services do you offer to your customers?
3.Who are your target customers or users?
4.What is your business model (e.g., subscriptions, product sales, partnerships)?

Goals for the Data
1.What is the main business goal you want to achieve using this dataset?
2.Are you looking for insights, dashboards, or a full analytics product?
3.Do you want real-time analysis or periodic reports (e.g., daily, weekly)?
4.Do you already have KPIs or metrics that matter most to your business?
5.Is the data collected from your own application or third-party devices or using any survey?
6.Are there known issues with data quality or consistency that I should be aware of?

Deliverables
1.What do you expect as the final outcome of my work?
2.A report? Dashboard? Data pipeline? Model?
3.Who will be using the output â€” business leaders, data analysts, or end users?
